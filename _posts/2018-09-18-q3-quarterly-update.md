Cross-Agency and Agency Priority Goal teams today released the latest updates on the progress of high-priority federal initiatives. The progress updates showcase what Agency Priority Goal (APG) teams achieved during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 (FY2018 Q3) and what Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal teams achieved during FY2018 Q3 and Q4. The progress updates highlight the milestones that teams continue to work towards as they advance toward the goals.
