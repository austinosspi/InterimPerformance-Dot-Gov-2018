The White House Leadership Development Program (WHLDP) is excited to announce that it has selected its fourth cohort of fellows. Over the past three years, the program has accelerated the development of 44 high-performing civil servants to help build the next cadre of leaders in the executive branch.

A key aspect of this program is empowering fellows to lead cross-agency and cross-functional work, such as the Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals in the President’s Management Agenda (PMA).  The fellowship challenges accomplished civil servants to reach beyond their areas of expertise and organizational boundaries to build coalitions, find solutions and drive change on some of government’s most systemic challenges.

[Insert quote from Margaret/Dustin] “We want leaders that will build a culture of continual change and improvement. We need leaders who can re-think, reform and modernize how we do government. That is the only way we will improve service today and be prepared to meet the challenges the American public will face in the future.”

This year’s cohort includes a broad cross-section of fellows with a rich set of experiences that will enable them to  share best practices and expertise, solve problems collaboratively, and tackle multi-agency initiatives.

WHLDP welcomes the following members to its 2019 cohort:
