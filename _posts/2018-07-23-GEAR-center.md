The Federal Government has fallen behind the curve in adapting how we operate to the realities of the 21st century and economy.  Most Federal entities and programs were designed many decades ago, and many of our organizations are aligned to the missions of the 19th century. Their designers could not have anticipated how technology and society would evolve or how the mission demands on government would look today.

The bottom line is that the Federal Government has been slower than the private sector to adapt operations to new realities, with reported decreases in trust and lower customer satisfaction. These failures mean we are not meeting the public’s expectations and that our use of resources is less than optimal. Moreover, reliance on outdated technology has led to a workforce insufficiently equipped to transition to more modern ways of doing business.

That’s why the Federal Government is pursuing a Government Effectiveness Advanced Research (GEAR) Center.  We seek to establish a public-private partnership to bring together experts in disciplines from economics, to computer science, to design thinking, in order to take a creative, data-driven, and interdisciplinary approach to new possibilities in how citizens and government interact.  Rather than a federally owned and operated institution, the GEAR Center would be housed and operated by non-federal partners.   

Through applied research and live pilot testing, the GEAR Center would connect cutting-edge thinking with real-world challenges government faces in serving Americans in the Digital Age.  This means re-imagining possibilities for how citizens interact with government; rethinking delivery of citizen services and data; reforming core processes like procurement and IT investment; and exploring how to develop, reskill and redeploy the public-sector workforce in creative ways.  The GEAR Center would help government catch up with where private-sector services and capabilities are today and lay the groundwork for where our operations and services need to be in five, 10, or 20 years.  

To get there, we need your help.  Right now, we are engaging the public, academics, experts, and industry to share ideas on how best to accomplish this goal, to learn from models that already exist, and to identify institutions interested in partnering with each other and with the Federal Government to establish the GEAR Center.
