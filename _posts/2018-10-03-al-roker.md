The weatherman and [anchor](https://twitter.com/PerformanceGov?lang=en) said Tuesday that he’s “feeling great” after undergoing “emergency carpal tunnel surgery” on Monday to fix a thumb issue that came up during rehearsals for his Broadway debut in Waitress.
“It had just gotten progressively worse to the point where Thursday, I lost use of my thumb during rehearsals,” Roker said on Today.
He set up the surgery the next day, and then went under the knife on Monday, with a general anesthetic.
“I didn’t want to see anything, know anything,” the dad of two said. “Just wanted to wake up dazed and confused — just a regular day for me!”
