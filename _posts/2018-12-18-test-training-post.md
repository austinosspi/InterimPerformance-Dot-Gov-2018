Santa Claus unveiled a new, modern approach to Christmas. Key improvements to the North Pole infrastructure include:
*An automated toy assembly line that frees up elves to spend more time on high-value toys for good little girls and boys
*A sleeker, streamlined sleigh design that will reduce Santa’s round-the-world time by 3.2 hours
*A comprehensive dashboard to display children’s real-time reactions to toys, which elves can use to inform gift decisions for future Christmases
