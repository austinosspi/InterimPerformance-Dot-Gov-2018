statement: "Leverage data as a strategic asset to grow the economy, increase the effectiveness of the Federal Government, facilitate oversight, and promote transparency."

challenge: "The use of data is transforming society, business, and the economy. Data provided by the Federal Government have a unique place in society and maintaining trust in Federal data is pivotal to a democratic process. The Federal Government needs a robust, integrated approach to using data to deliver on mission, serve customers, and steward resources while respecting privacy and confidentiality."

opportunity: "There are opportunities to: develop a long-term, enterprise-wide Federal Data Strategy to better govern and leverage the Federal Governmentâ€™s data; enable government data to be accessible and useful for the American public, businesses, and researchers; improve the use of data for decision-making and accountability for the Federal Government, including for policy-making, innovation, oversight, and learning."
