      <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals are a tool used by leadership to accelerate progress on a limited number of Presidential priority areas where implementation requires active collaboration among multiple agencies. Long-term in nature, CAP Goals drive cross-government collaboration to tackle government-wide management challenges affecting most agencies.</p>
        <p>As a subset of Presidential priorities, CAP Goals are used to implement the President’s Management Agenda and are complemented by other cross-agency coordination and goal-setting efforts. CAP Goals are updated or revised every four years with each Presidential Administration’s term.</p>
        <p>CAP Goals fall into four categories: key drivers of transformation, cross-cutting priority areas, functional priority areas and mission priority areas.</p>
      <h4>Key Drivers of Transformation</h4>
