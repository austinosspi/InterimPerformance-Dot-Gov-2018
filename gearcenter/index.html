<p>The Federal Government intends to establish a Government Effectiveness Advanced Research (GEAR) Center through a public-private partnership to improve mission delivery, citizen services, and stewardship of public resources.</p>

<!--
<p>Through applied research and live pilot testing, the GEAR Center would connect cutting-edge thinking with real-world challenges the Federal Government faces in serving Americans in the Digital Age, specifically:</p>
<ul>
 <li>re-imagining possibilities for how citizens interact with the Government;</li>

<li>rethinking the delivery of citizen services and data; reforming core processes (e.g., procurement, budget, IT investment and capital allocation); and </li>
<li> exploring how the public-sector workforce can be developed, reskilled and redeployed in creative ways.</li>
</ul>-->
<p>To get there, we need your help.  Right now, we are engaging the public, academics, experts, and industry to share ideas on how best to accomplish this goal, to learn from models that already exist, and to identify institutions interested in partnering with each other and with the Federal Government to establish the GEAR Center. Request for Information (RFI) Submissions are due on September 14, 2018 through email to performance@omb.eop.gov. </p>

<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>The Federal Government has been slower than the private sector to adapt operations to new realities, with reported decreases in trust and lower customer satisfaction. These failures mean we are not meeting the publicâ€™s expectations and that our use of resources is less than optimal. Moreover, reliance on outdated technology has led to a workforce insufficiently equipped to transition to more modern ways of doing business.</p></center>

<h3>The Opportunity</h3>
<p> The GEAR Center would bring together experts in disciplines from economics, to computer science, to design thinking, in order to take a creative, data-driven, and interdisciplinary approach to new possibilities in how citizens and government interact.  The GEAR Center can help government catch up with where private-sector services and capabilities are today and lay the groundwork for where our operations and services need to be in five, 10, or 20 years.</p></center>
