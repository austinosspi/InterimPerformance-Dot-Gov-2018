- title: IT Modernization
  statement: The Executive Branch will build and maintain more modern, secure, and resilient information technology (IT) to enhance mission delivery and productivity – driving value by increasing efficiencies of Government IT spending while potentially reducing costs, increasing efficiencies, and enhancing citizen engagement and satisfaction with the services we provide.
  challenge: The challenge includes:   limited accountability for achieving enterprise-wide outcomes that enhance IT service effectiveness and reduce cybersecurity risks; slow adoption of cutting edge commercial technologies due to onerous acquisition and authorization processes; and federal agencies employ patchwork network architectures and rely on legacy systems that are costly and difficult to secure and upgrade.
  opportunity: There are opportunities to:   expand the use of modern commercial technologies that are effective, economical, and secure; reduce the impact of cybersecurity risks by safeguarding IT systems, sensitive data, and networks; leverage common solutions and innovative practices to improve efficiency, increase security, and ultimately meet citizens’ needs.

- title: Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset
  statement: Leverage data as a strategic asset to grow the economy, increase the effectiveness of the Federal Government, facilitate oversight, and promote transparency.
  challenge: The use of data is transforming society, business, and the economy. Data provided by the Federal Government have a unique place in society and maintaining trust in Federal data is pivotal to a democratic process. The Federal Government needs a robust, integrated approach to using data to deliver on mission, serve customers, and steward resources while respecting privacy and confidentiality.
  opportunity: There are opportunities to:   develop a long-term, enterprise-wide Federal Data Strategy to better govern and leverage the Federal Government’s data; enable government data to be accessible and useful for the American public, businesses, and researchers; improve the use of data for decision-making and accountability for the Federal Government, including for policy-making, innovation, oversight, and learning.
